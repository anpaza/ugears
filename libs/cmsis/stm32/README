These are the microcontroller startup files from ST CubeMX libraries.
The following changes were made to them:

 * BUG: in startup files for STM32F2*, F4, H7* the invocation of main
   was like this:

        /* Call the application's entry point.*/
        bl  main
        bx  lr

   but there's no guarantee main returns lr equal to the address of "bx".
   In fact, gcc will generate code this way:

        push {lr}
        ...
        pop {pc}

   if you call any function from main, LR gets changed, and when you
   return from main() "bx lr" will jump right into the middle of your main.

   So, in all files all "bx lr"s were replaced by:

    1:  b   1b
